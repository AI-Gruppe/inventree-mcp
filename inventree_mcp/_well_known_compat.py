"""Compat shim for InvenTree versions that don't yet provide WellKnownMixin.

WellKnownMixin (letting a plugin advertise entries under /.well-known/) was
added in inventree/InvenTree#12698, merged to InvenTree's master branch but
not yet present in a "stable" release. InvenTreeMCP must still import and
load cleanly on older InvenTree instances, so this falls back to a blank
mixin that simply advertises nothing when the real one isn't available.
